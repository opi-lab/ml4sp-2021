Read Independent Component Analysis [chapter][chapter] from DSP with Matlab (Giron-Sierra) and run the [included programs][prog].
Answer the following questions:

1. What does ICA do better than PCA when considering a mix of sources? Use the matlab programs to show an example.
2. What is *whitening* and why is it important for ICA? Use the matlab programs to show an example.
3. Why can't the sources be Gaussian random data for ICA?
